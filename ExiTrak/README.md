# ExiTrak
BME 462 Project: Design for the Developing World

This project seeks to create a product designed to track the exercise band stretches of patients in Western Virginia.
The patients in these areas suffer from high rates of COPD and diabetes, and healthcare is limited, so community workers prescribe patients exercises to do at home.
With this project, healthcare workers can keep their patients accountable and improve the community's quality of life.

Please see Project_Explanation.pdf for more details on the background of the project.
