The URL in the .txt file takes one to the MedAware page, part of the MedHacks 2019 webpage. MedAware was a novel concept created to combat implicit bias in hospitals through the use of smart cameras that can characterize patient-doctor interaction, giving hospital administrators and doctors data to make informed decisions about reducing implicit bias and improving patient outcomes. MedAware won the Improving Health Outcomes track at MedHacks 2019 at Johns Hopkins University, and is being considered for implementation in the Johns Hopkins Healthcare system.
