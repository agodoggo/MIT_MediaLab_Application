Byklyt is a Design Challenge project for my BME 590 Design Fundamentals Class.
The class was challenged to create their vision for a bike light.
I tried to push the limits of innovation with my design.
The design has a 555 timer connected to an LED whose frequency of blinking is controlled by the turning of the case.
The light turns on when the case is attached to the clamp on the bike handle, there is a reed switch which snaps on when it is near the magnet in the clamp.
