Portfolio to accompany MIT MediaLab Application

This Portfolio contains 6 projects that showcase my abilities.

ExiTrak is a current design project to improve health outcomes for patients suffering from COPD and diabetes in rural West Virginia.
BykLyt is an avant-garde design for an intuitive bike light of the future.
MedAware is a combination of Raspberry Pi with Node.js to characterize patient-doctor interactions to reduce implicit bias in hospitals and improve patient outcomes, it won 1st place in the Improving Patient Outcomes Track at the JHU Medhacks 2019.
Spiro is an open-source design project intended to open diagnostics to patients who don't have regular access to healthcare providers. Spiro can measure metrics about a patient's breathing ability, allowing one to diagnose if they have asthma or other respiratory ailments.
Lab Designs is a portfolio of different lab tools I prototyped and built for use in Dr. Karra's clinical research lab.
Monochrometer GUI is the python GUI I built for Dr. Bertrand Boussert to conduct his spectrometer experiment using multiple lab instruments in conjunction.
